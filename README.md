# Virtulum

This is a web application that allows users to create, edit and save invoices on an account. It does not allow users to automatically send emails from the application but rather generate them for download.

## Technologies

This app uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to render components as well as using the built in API routes.
The database connected to this is a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) serverless database.
Finally, I am using [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) to render some components more easily.
